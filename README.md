My first website is about my shared apartment (The Star WG). I changed all names and pictures because of privacy.

contains:
  - index.html (homepage)
  - theCrew.html (my roomates)
  - starChefs.html (our favourite easy recipes)
  - gallery.html (a video "gallery", contains only one video)
  - contact.html (take contact if you're looking for a room :P)
  - messageSubmit.html (link where you'll get after submitting your message)
  - stylesheet.css (stylesheet for every hmtl file in project)
  - stylesheet.scss (sass stylesheet)
  - .gitattributes (for git large file storage of video)
